# CloakId

### Hide your database ids from users of your webapp.

Using sequential ids makes predicting the ids of other resources in your application simple, and can provide details
about how your app is growing (how many users, etc.) to current and potential competitors.   Obfuscating identifiers isn't
meant to be a primary means of providing security, but it can help to keep confidential information from being completely
public.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cloak_id'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cloak_id
